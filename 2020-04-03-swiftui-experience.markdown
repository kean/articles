I had an idea how to improve the logging experience on iOS. I wanted a way to quickly view logs on the device. I needed to build a console. But I didn't want to build it only for iOS. I also wanted to have a similar but more powerful console on macOS. This looked like a perfect opportunity to use SwiftUI.

It took me a few weekends to finish the project. It is called [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse) and it is available for my [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kean).

SwiftUI is great in [theory]({{ site.url }}/post/swiftui-layout-system). It looks fantastic on slides. But how good is the experience of using SwiftUI? Were it able to deliver on its promises? How much code were I able to reuse? You can learn about it in this post.
