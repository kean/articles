I've been using SwiftUI [a lot]({{ site.url }}/post/appkit-is-done) lately and loved many ideas behind it. So I was thinking, can we apply them to the apps written with RxSwift or ReactiveSwift? SwiftUI also uses a reactive framework, [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine), for updating its views. But as a user, you don't even think about Combine when writing SwiftUI code. Why should it be different with RxSwift?

I already spent a significant amount of time investigating how Swift Data Flow works under the hood [last year]({{ site.url }}/post/swiftui-data-flow), so I had a good idea of what I needed to do to make it work. I built a quick proof-of-concept project called [RxUI](https://github.com/kean/RxUI) to demonstrate this different way of using RxSwift. It especially suits folk who prefer to use unidirectional view models.

## Developer Experience

Let's start with a developer experience. There are three major components provided by RxUI which directly map to the respective SwiftUI concepts:

- `RxObservableObject`
- `RxPublished`
- `RxView`

If you are familiar with SwiftUI, you probably already know how it's going to go.

### RxObservableObject

You can think of `RxObservableObject` and `RxPublished` as analogs of SwiftUI `ObservableObject` and `Published`.

```swift
final class LoginViewModel: RxObservableObject {
    @RxPublished var email = ""
    @RxPublished var password = ""
    @RxPublished private(set) var isLoading = false

    var title: String {
        "Welcome, \(email)"
    }

    var isLoginButtonEnabled: Bool {
        isInputValid && !isLoading
    }

    private var isInputValid: Bool {
        !email.isEmpty && !password.isEmpty
    }

    func login() {
        isLoading = true
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .seconds(2)) {
            self.isLoading = false
        }
    }
}
```

Each `RxObservableObject` has an `objectWillChange` relay. The relay is generated automatically and is automatically bound to all properties marked with `@RxPublished` property wrapper. It all happens in runtime using reflection and associated objects.

You probably already noticed one of the major advantages of `RxUI` compared to a typical `RxSwift` view model: you can't even see any of the reactive code! `RxUI` allows you to express your business logic in a natural way using plain Swift properties and methods. This makes it easier to write, read, and, more importantly, debug code.

### RxView

`RxView` is an analog of a SwiftUI `View`. There is one crucial difference. In `UIKit`, views are expensive, you can't simply recreate them each time. The is reflected in `RxView` design.

```swift
final class LoginViewController: UIViewController, RxView {
    private let model = LoginViewModel()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // ... create view

        disposeBag.insert(
            emailTextField.rx.text.bind(to: model.$email),
            passwordTextField.rx.text.bind(to: model.$password),
            loginButton.rx.tap.subscribe(onNext: model.login)
        )

        bind(model) // Automatically registers for updates
    }

    // Called automatically when model changes, but no more frequently than
    // once per render cycle.
    func refreshView() {
        titleLabel.text = model.title
        model.isLoading ? spinner.startAnimating() : spinner.stopAnimating()
        loginButton.isEnabled = model.isLoginButtonEnabled
    }
}
```

When you call `bind()`, the view automatically registers for the `RxObservableObject` updates delivered via `objectWillChange` property. When the object is changed, `refreshView()` is called automatically. `RxView` hooks into the display system such that `refreshView` called only once per one render cycle.

Again, as you can see there is barely any explicit reactive code in this sample. If you are debugging, you can put a breakpoint right into `refreshView()` and directly query any of the view model properties.

Here is [a video](https://youtu.be/3_ul6DNbxDU) demonstrating that this is not just pseudocode, it works. You can find the demo project in [the repo](https://github.com/kean/RxUI).

## What Dark Sorcery is This?

I'm afraid it's open source, so all the secrets are already revealed. Can you guess how much code was needed to make this proof-of-concept work? 80 lines of code. The key to the solution is reflection.

### RxObservableObject

Let's start by solving the first problem. This is a definition of `RxObservableObject` protocol:

```swift
public protocol RxObservableObject: AnyObject {
    var objectWillChange: PublishRelay<Void> { get }
}
```

How to implement `objectWillChange` so that each class that conforms to this protocol has it auto-generated for them? This is easy, associated objects.

```swift
public extension RxObservableObject {
    var objectWillChange: PublishRelay<Void> {
        if let relay = objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &objectWillChangeAssociatedKey) as? PublishRelay<Void> {
            return relay
        }
        let relay = PublishRelay<Void>()
        // ... additional dark magic is hidden here and will reveal itself later ...
        objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &objectWillChangeAssociatedKey, relay, .OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN)
        return relay
    }
}
```

Now let's work on `RxPublished`. The implementation is trivial, here it is in its entirety:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
public struct RxPublished<Value>: RxPublishedProtocol {
    private let relay: BehaviorRelay<Value>
    var publishedWillChange: Observable<Void> { relay.map { _ in () } }

    public init(wrappedValue: Value) {
        relay = .init(value: wrappedValue)
    }

    public var wrappedValue: Value {
        set { relay.accept(newValue) }
        get { relay.value }
    }

    public var projectedValue: BehaviorRelay<Value> { relay }
}

protocol RxPublishedProtocol {
    var publishedWillChange: Observable<Void> { get }
}
```

Let's say your view model conforms to `RxObservableObject` and has three properties marked as `RxPublished`.

```swift
final class LoginViewModel: RxObservableObject {
    @RxPublished var email = ""
    @RxPublished var password = ""
    @RxPublished private(set) var isLoading = false
}
```

Currently, if you change any of these properties, nothing happens yet. `objectWillChange` isn't going to fire. Now, how are we going to connect them, what are we going to do? Or, we are going to use a [super secret](https://forums.swift.org/t/property-wrappers-access-to-both-enclosing-self-and-wrapper-instance/32526) `_enclosingInstance` property wrapper subscript, right? No.

When I showed `objectWillChange` implementation earlier, there wa a method call that I left out.

```swift
public extension RxObservableObject {
    var objectWillChange: PublishRelay<Void> {
        // ... return exsiting relay 
        registerPublishedProperties()
        // ... create new relay and associated it
    }
}
```

Turns out, `objectWillChange` to register the published properties. And we can do that using reflection and `RxPublishedProtocol` protocol that I showed earlier.

```swift
private extension RxObservableObject {
    func registerPublishedProperties(objectWillChange: PublishRelay<Void>) {
        let allPublished = Mirror(reflecting: self)
            .children
            .compactMap { $0.value as? RxPublishedProtocol }
        let disposeBag = getDisposeBag(for: self)
        for published in allPublished {
            published.publishedWillChange.bind(to: objectWillChange).disposed(by: disposeBag)
        }
    }
}
```

OK, this was one piece of the puzzle. Now when you have a view model and you change any of the properties, `objectWillChange` event associated with the model itself is going to fire. Now, how do we refresh the view?

### RxView

The `RxView` protocol is as simple as it gets. You call the default `bind` method to register the observable object. When the observable object changes, `refreshView` is called (not really, more details later).

```swift
public protocol RxView: AnyObject {
    func refreshView()
}

public extension RxView where Self: UIViewController {
    func bind(_ object: RxObservableObject)
}

public extension RxView where Self: UIView {
    func bind(_ object: RxObservableObject)
}
```

The naive approach is easy. All you need to do is subscribe to `objectWillChange` and call `refreshView`, right?

```swift
public extension RxView where Self: UIViewController {
    func bind(_ object: RxObservableObject) {
        refershView()
        object.objectWillChange
            .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] in self?.refershView() })
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)
    }
}
```

Well, not so fast. There are two problems with this approach. First, efficiency. We don't want `refreshView` to be called on _every_ published property change, we want to coalesce updates. Second, a bit more severe, it crashes.

```swift
final class LoginViewController: UIViewController, RxView {
    func refreshView() {
    	// ... 
        model.isLoading ? spinner.startAnimating() : spinner.stopAnimating()
    }
}
```

If `refreshView()` gets called as a result of `isLoading` value change, Swift will crash with "Simultaneous accesses to …, but modification requires exclusive access" diagnostic message. This is [Swift 5 Exclusivity Enforcement](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-exclusivity/) in action. Fortunately, there is a single solution for both of these problems.

Why does `refreshView()` get called? To make sure the updated state is displayed during the next render cycle. So all we need to do hook into the render system, easy?

```swift
// This is a slightly simplified version, the real one works with `UIView` too
public extension RxView where Self: UIViewController {
    func bind(_ object: RxObservableObject) {
        let emptyView = UIView()
        emptyView.isHidden = true
        view.addSubview(emptyView)

        refreshView()

        object.objectWillChange
            .subscribe(onNext: emptyView.setNeedsLayout)
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)

        emptyView.rx.sentMessage(#selector(UIView.layoutSubviews))
            .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] _ in self?.refreshView() })
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)
    }
}
```

Now, this is part of the solution that I'm not confident in, and the reason I would like to reiterate that `RxUI` is a *proof-of-concept*.

The idea is to take advantage of the fact that `UIView.layoutSubviews` gets called automatically by UIKit before displaying a view. This is our chance to refresh the views properties.

One of the known disadvantages is that it introduces a window of time in which your views are temporarily out of sync with your view models. You should make sure that all of the view state is stored in the view model. Pretend that this is SwiftUI and you don't have access to the view state.

## Conclusion

`RxUI` was a fun exercise. I think it has potential due to how many DX improvements it offers compared to low-level Rx:

- You can express your business logic in a natural way using plain Swift properties and methods
- It makes it much easier to debug your views and view models. You can set breakpoints and query any of your view model state.
- It’s beginner-friendly. You don’t need to learn `combineLatest`, `withLatestFrom` and other complex stateful operators to use it. You don't need `flatMap` to send a network request.
- It is more efficient because you avoid creating massive observable chains

I would like to reiterate that `RxUI` is a *proof-of-concept*, so please use it at your own risk.
